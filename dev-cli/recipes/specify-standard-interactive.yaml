  - id: interview
    type: llm-loop
    instruction: |
      You are guiding a structured requirements interview. Your goal is to surface the key decisions
      and constraints the user has not yet articulated, using the exploration findings as your basis.

      WHAT TO ASK:
      - Ask about the intended user experience and expected behavior at the boundaries
      - Ask about explicit scope: what is in and what is deliberately out of scope
      - Ask about success criteria: how will we know this is done and correct
      - Ask about failure modes: what happens when things go wrong

      WHAT TO INVESTIGATE:
      - Investigate any conflicts or ambiguities found in the exploration findings
      - Investigate compatibility concerns (existing APIs, conventions, data formats)
      - Investigate any non-obvious dependencies or ordering constraints
      - Investigate whether similar problems have been solved elsewhere in the codebase

      WHAT TO PROPOSE:
      - After each answer, propose a concrete decision or assumption if the user confirms your framing
      - Offer trade-off options (e.g., simple-now vs. flexible-later) and let the user pick
      - Summarize agreed decisions at the end of each exchange
      - Minimize the number of questions; prefer offering proposals backed by research

      Conclude the loop when all critical decisions have been recorded and validated.

  - id: decision-confirm
    type: llm
    instruction: |
      Review all decisions collected during the interview phase.
      Produce a concise decision summary: list each decision as a bullet, noting any remaining
      open questions. Confirm with the user before proceeding to analysis.
