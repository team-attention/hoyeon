      Classify the user intent for this session. Choose the single best category:
        Feature / Bug / Refactor / Architecture / Migration / Performance / Research
      Output a short intent statement (1-2 sentences) naming the category and the goal.

  - id: interview
    type: llm-loop
    instruction: |
      You are guiding a focused, time-boxed requirements interview. Keep it concise — quick mode
      means fewer questions and faster decisions. Use the exploration findings as your basis.

      WHAT TO ASK:
      - Ask about the most important success criterion: what does "done" look like
      - Ask about scope boundaries: what is explicitly out of scope for this change
      - Ask one question at a time; do not pile up questions in a single message

      WHAT TO INVESTIGATE:
      - Investigate any single critical ambiguity discovered during exploration
      - Investigate whether there are any hard constraints (performance, compatibility, API contract)

      WHAT TO PROPOSE:
      - After each answer, immediately propose a decision or assumption and ask for confirmation
      - Prefer concrete proposals over open-ended questions
      - Summarize all agreed decisions at the end of the interview

      Exit when the key success criterion and scope boundary are confirmed.
