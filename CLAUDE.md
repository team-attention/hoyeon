# Project Guidelines

## Experimentation

Use `.playground/` directory for experiments and testing. This directory is git-ignored.

## Agent/Skill Development

### validate_prompt

To automatically validate agent/skill output, add a `validate_prompt` field to the frontmatter.

**Agent example** (`.claude/agents/my-agent.md`):
```yaml
---
name: my-agent
description: My custom agent
validate_prompt: |
  Must contain X, Y, Z sections.
  Output should be in JSON format.
---
```

**Skill example** (`.claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md`):
```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: My custom skill
validate_prompt: |
  Must produce valid output.
---
```

**How it works:**
1. `PostToolUse` hook detects Task/Skill completion
2. Extracts `subagent_type` or `skill` name from tool input
3. Finds agent/skill file and parses `validate_prompt` from frontmatter
4. Outputs validation reminder to Claude

### Implementation Files

- `.claude/scripts/validate-output.sh` - PostToolUse validation hook
- `.claude/settings.json` - registers PostToolUse hook for Task|Skill

## Hook System

Hooks are registered in `.claude/settings.json` and automate pipeline transitions and quality enforcement.

### Hook Types

| Type | When it fires | Use case |
|------|--------------|----------|
| `SessionStart` | Session begins | Initialize session-level state |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | User submits a prompt | Initialize state, intercept slash commands |
| `PreToolUse` | Before a tool executes | Block or modify tool calls |
| `PostToolUse` | After a tool completes | Validate output, trigger follow-up |
| `Stop` | Session ends | Transition to next pipeline stage |

### Active Hooks

| Script | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `execute-compact-hook.sh` | SessionStart | Handle compact session resume for /execute |
| `ultrawork-init-hook.sh` | UserPromptSubmit | Initialize ultrawork pipeline state when `/ultrawork` is typed |
| `skill-session-init.sh` | UserPromptSubmit + PreToolUse[Skill] | Initialize session state for specify/execute skills |
| `rv-detector.sh` | UserPromptSubmit | Detect `!rv` keyword to trigger re-validation loop |
| `rulph-init.sh` | PreToolUse[Skill] | Initialize rulph loop state on skill invocation |
| `skill-session-guard.sh` | PreToolUse[Edit\|Write] | Plan guard (specify) / orchestrator guard (execute) |
| `ralph-dod-guard.sh` | PreToolUse[Edit\|Write] | Enforce DoD before allowing writes in /ralph loop |
| `validate-output.sh` | PostToolUse[Task\|Skill] | Validate agent/skill output against `validate_prompt` frontmatter |
| `ultrawork-stop-hook.sh` | Stop | Advance ultrawork pipeline on session stop |
| `skill-session-stop.sh` | Stop | Block exit if execute has incomplete tasks (circuit breaker: 30 iter) |
| `rv-validator.sh` | Stop | Run re-validation pass on stop |
| `rulph-stop.sh` | Stop | Handle rulph loop termination |
| `ralph-stop.sh` | Stop | Ralph loop DoD verification + prompt re-injection |
| `skill-session-cleanup.sh` | SessionEnd | Clean up session dir (`rm -rf ~/.hoyeon/{session_id}/`) |

### Hook Development Notes

- Hook scripts live in `.claude/scripts/` and must be executable (`chmod +x`)
- Register hooks in `.claude/settings.json` under `hooks.<EventType>.matchers[]`
- A hook script that is not registered in settings will **not fire** — creating the file alone is not enough
- See [docs/learnings/lessons-learned.md](docs/learnings/lessons-learned.md) for additional hook behavior gotchas

## Git Branching & Release

- **`main`** — release only. Do not commit directly.
- **`develop`** — integration branch. Feature branches merge here.
- **Feature branches** — `feat/xxx` from `develop`, merge back to `develop` via `--no-ff`.

### Release Flow

```
1. All features merged to develop
2. Version bump commit on develop (plugin.json + marketplace.json + cli/package.json)
3. Update CLAUDE.md (Recent Changes) and README.md (if new skills/agents added)
4. cd cli && npm run build && npm publish --access public
5. git checkout main && git merge develop --no-ff -m "Release X.Y.Z"
6. git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin main --tags && git push origin develop
7. gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "vX.Y.Z" --notes "## What's New in X.Y.Z ..."
```

## Versioning

- Plugin version is in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, and `cli/package.json`
- **Bump all three files** in a single commit on `develop` before merging to `main`
- CLI version (`@team-attention/hoyeon-cli`) is always synced with plugin version

## Recent Changes (v0.8.1)

- fix(hooks): remove deleted rph-cleanup.sh from hooks.json SessionEnd
- refactor: replace `node cli/dist/cli.js` with `hoyeon-cli` globally
- chore: sync cli version to 0.8.0 and update release flow

## Previous Changes (v0.8.0)

- refactor(cli): rename `dev-cli/` to `cli/`, bundle with esbuild into single `dist/cli.js` (all deps inlined, no node_modules needed)
- feat(cli): prepare npm publish as `@team-attention/hoyeon-cli` (package.json, bin entry, publishConfig)
- refactor(cli): rename user-facing strings from `dev-cli` to `hoyeon-cli` in all help/error output
- refactor(hooks,skills,docs): update all references from `dev-cli/bin/dev-cli.js` to `cli/dist/cli.js`
- feat(hooks): add pre-commit hook to auto-rebuild `cli/dist/cli.js` on source changes (`scripts/pre-commit-cli-build.sh`)

## Testing Strategy

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for the 4-Tier Testing Model (Unit → Integration → E2E → Agent Sandbox). Verification agents use this as their framework.

## Lessons Learned

See [docs/learnings/lessons-learned.md](docs/learnings/lessons-learned.md) for hook/tool behavior gotchas discovered during development.
